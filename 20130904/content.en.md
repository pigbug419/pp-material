## Introduction ##

Welcome, students of Principles of Programming! In lab session,
you are going to grasp hands-on experience on concepts on programming
you've taught in the lecture session.

### Time/Place ###
* lab session will be at Bldg 302 Rm 311-2 every Wednesday.
* TA's office hour is Mon/Wed 15:00-16:00 (right before class). Visit
  at Bldg 302 Rm 312-2 Programming Laboratory.

* [TA page](http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~ta/4190.210/13/): A page
  maintained by TAs. lab sessions and grading.
* [Board](https://ropas.snu.ac.kr/phpbb/viewforum.php?f=30): Online
Q&A. If you want to ask on course materials, please do here.
  + **Important**: All students should sign on the board by their

* [Lab materials](http://www.github.com/lunaticas/pp-material):
  All lab materials are stored here. We will provide links from
  the TA page and the board, so you don't have to look at it.

### Lab Language ###

* In lab session, you will use [Racket](http://racket-lang.org)
and [Ocaml](http://caml.inria.fr). We will start with Racket.

### Lab Session ###

* TAs will give you materials.
* You will do the labwork.
* If you have a question, ask to TAs.
* Grade the answer by yourself with self-grader (presented by TAs).
* If the self-grader says correct, submit the answer at the
  [labwork submission](http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~ta/4190.210/13/lab/)
  page.
  + **Submit here** except for extraordinary
  circumstances. Especially, don't submit via email.
* If you submit no later than 24hrs after the lab session, you
  will get 100% of your score. There might be a minus if you submit
  later than 24hrs.
  + If you submit multiple times, only the last one is counted
  for. For example, if you submitted an answer 18hrs after the
  lab session and another answer 30 hrs after, only the latter is
  effective.

### Homeworks and Projects ###

* TAs will give you self-graders for homeworks and projects.
  + Self-graders are only for testing input/output formats, and real
  grading is not performed by this self-graders.
  + Warning: as TAs provide self-graders, **TAs will not give you any
  scores if you fail to fulfill input/output specifications**.
* Submit homeworks and project at
[homework submission](http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~ta/4190.210/13/hw/)
page.
  + As the same with labwork, **Submit here** except for
  extraordinary circumstances.
* You get 90% of your score if you submit no later than 24hrs after
  the deadline; 80% for 48 hrs.
  + As the same with labwork, the only the lastly submitted answer is
  counted for.

## Racket ##

### Installation ###

Download [Racket v5.3.6](http://racket-lang.org/download/) and install
it.

* **Caution**: Use **v5.3.6 only** in this class. TAs grade your
    submissions with this version.
* Racket is already installed in this room.

### Hello, World! ###

Today, you will write down a program which write down "Hello, World!".
As it is the first day, TAs provided the [solution](helloWorld.rkt)
:-)  
You're not required to understand this program for now.

* The link above points to not the file itself but a page on the
file. If you click "Raw" in the page, you will get the file itself.

#### Self-grader ####

Download [self-grader](helloWorldGrade.rkt) and put it at the same
directory with `helloWorld.rkt`. Open `helloWorldGrade.rkt` and run
it. If an `O` comes out, you succeeded in self-grading!

* Filename should be `helloWorld.rkt` or grader won't work. In
  Linux, you should match the cases.
* You may run in the command line by:
`racket helloWorldGrade.rkt`  


#### Submission ####

At [Labwork submission](http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~ta/4190.210/13/lab/)
page, submit `helloWorld.rkt` as No. 1.
