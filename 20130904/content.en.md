Welcome, students of Principles of Programming! In practice session,
you are going to grasp hands-on experience on concepts on programming
you've taught in the lecture session.

### Time/Place ###

  All practice materials are stored here. We will provide links from
  the TA page and the board, so you don't have to look at it.

### Practice Language ###

* In practice session, you will use [Racket](http://racket-lang.org)
and [Ocaml](http://caml.inria.fr). We will start with Racket.

### Practice Session ###

* TAs will give you materials.
* You will do the labworks.
* If you have a question, ask to TAs.
* Grade the answer by yourself with self-grader (presented by TAs).
* If the self-grade says correct, submit the answer at the
  [labwork submission](http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~ta/4190.210/13/lab/)
  page.
  + **Submit here** except for extraordinary
  circumstances. Especially, don't submit via email.
* You may leave if you submitted.
* If you submit no later than 24hrs after the practice session, you
  will get 100% of your score. There might be a minus if you submit
  later than 24hrs.
  + If you submit multiple times, only the last one is counted
  for. For example, if you submitted an answer 18hrs after the
  practice session and another answer 30 hrs after, only the latter is
  effective.

### Homeworks and Projects ###

* Prof. Yi gives homeworks and projects.
* TAs will give you self-graders.
  + Self-graders are only for testing input/output formats, and real
  grading is not performed by this self-graders.
  + Warning: as TAs provide self-graders, **TAs will not give you any
  scores if you fail to fulfill input/output specifications**.
* Submit homeworks and project at
[homework submission](http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~ta/4190.210/13/hw/)
page.
  + As the same with labworks, **Submit here** except for
  extraordinary circumstances.
* You get 90% of your score if you submit no later than 24hrs after
  the deadline; 80% for 48 hrs.
  + As the same with labworks, the only the lastly submitted answer is
  counted for.

## Racket ##

### Installation ###

Download [Racket v5.3.6](http://racket-lang.org/download/) and install
it.

* **Caution**: Use **v5.3.6 버전만** in this class. TAs grade your
    submissions with this version.
* Racket is already installed in this room.

### Hello, World! ###

Today, you will write down a program which write down "Hello, World!".
As it is the first day, TAs provided the [solution](helloWorld.racket)
:-)  
You're not required to understand this program for now.

#### Self-grader ####

Download [self-grade](helloWorldGrade.racket) and put it at the same
directory with `helloWorld.racket`. TODO

* Filename should be `helloWorld.racket` or grader won't work. In
  Linux, you should match the cases.
* You may run in the command line:
`TODO`
