  ### Order of reviewed answers
  
  Before clicking `SUBMIT`, all of graded answers should be sorted in
  decreasing graded order.  If they are not, you will encounter the
  next error message.  Please, sort the answers by dragging before
  clicking `SUBMIT`.
  
  If there are two answers that have the same score, change the score
  to any other number and rearrange them in decreasing graded order.
